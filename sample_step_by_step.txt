  x/2+4 = 15
Put each term in x/2+4 over the common denominator 2: x/2+4  =  x/2+8/2:
  x/2+8/2 = 15
x/2+8/2 = (x+8)/2:
  (x+8)/2 = 15
Multiply both sides of (x+8)/2 = 15 by 2:
  (2 (x+8))/2 = 2×15
(2 (x+8))/2 = 2/2×(x+8) = x+8:
  x+8 = 2×15
2×15  =  30:
  x+8 = 30
Subtract 8 from both sides:
  x+(8-8) = 30-8
8-8 = 0:
  x = 30-8
30-8 = 22:
Answer: |  
 | x = 22

x/2+4 = 15
x/2+8/2 = 15
(x+8)/2 = 15
(2 (x+8))/2 = 2×15
x+8 = 2×15
x+8 = 30
x+(8-8) = 30-8
x = 30-8
x = 22
